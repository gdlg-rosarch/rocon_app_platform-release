  * [rocon_app_manager] pass a ros compatible name to the rapp.
  * [rocon_app_manager] remove unnecessary, and old, comment.
  * [rocon_app_manager] bugfix the bugfix for status publishing
    Didn't look around properly - this corrects the last bugfix to make sure
    all variables are properly defined before publishing the status.
  * [rocon_app_manager] remove debug print.
  * [rocon_app_manager] base name handling should be same for uuids or not.
    Wasn't applying the correct conversion rules (lower, space->'_') for
    standalone mode so that the namespaced topics/services conform to ros
    conventions.
  * [rocon_app_manager] bugfix handling of nonexistant current rapp.
    Was mistakenly assuming that this is always available. This handles the
    case when it is None.
  * removing running rapps from listrapps
